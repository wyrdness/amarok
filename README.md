## Overview

Amarok is a gigantic wolf from Inuit mythology that hunts alone, contrasting with normal wolves that hunt in packs. This enormous creature stalks the Arctic night, specifically targeting hunters who foolishly hunt alone at night, breaking traditional safety rules.

The Amarok serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hunting alone and the importance of respecting wilderness safety and traditional hunting practices. Unlike the social structure of real wolves, the Amarok is a solitary predator, symbolizing the consequences of isolation and recklessness in the harsh Arctic environment.
